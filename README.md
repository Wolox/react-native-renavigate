# renavigate

#### React native navigation made easy using redux

`renavigate` works with [react redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/) on top of [navigator component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html) to allow an easy navigation management in your react native apps.

## TL;DR
Check the quick start [example](Example/README.md)

## Prerequisites
- redux
- react-redux

## Preface
If you are used to handling your routes with react native's default navigator and also like using redux, you will love renavigate. This library will keep your app's component structure simple and make your transitions much easier to accomplish transforming the [Navigator API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html#methods) into redux actions.  
Last but not least, navigation related components like tab bar and navigation bar are easily pluggable and customizable.

### Installation

#### npm
```bash
npm install --save react-native-renavigate
```

#### yarn
```bash
yarn add react-native-renavigate
```
### Getting started

#### 1- Declare your routes

```js
const routes = {
  POST_DETAIL: (post) => ({
    component: PostDetailContainer,
    params: {
      post
    }
  }),
  POSTS_LIST: (posts) => ({
    component: PostListContainer,
    params: {
      posts
    }
  })
};
```

Define each route in your app as a function that returns a plain object that will represent it. These objects should at least have one attribute named `component` that references the root component of the route (the `component` attribute is mandatory). The `param` attribute of the route object will be used as prop of the route component when mounting it.

All your route definition functions must be contained in an object where each key is the route name (this name will be used with the redux actions later).

#### 2- Mount the root scene

```js
import { RootSceneContainer } from 'react-native-renavigate';

import store from './store';
import routes from './routes';
import posts from './posts.json';

export default function index() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <RootSceneContainer
        initialRoute={routes.POSTS_LIST({ posts })}
        routes={routes}
      />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

The `RootSceneContainer` component is our wrapper of react native Navigator, and will properly transform store changes into routes transitions. These store changes are triggered by renavigate actions, stay tunned!

###### * Using tabs
Our root component will need the tab definitions to properly handle them.
The tabs definition must follow the following format:

```js
const tabs = [
  {
    label: 'First tab',
    initialRoute: routes.FIRST_TAB_INITIAL_ROUTE()
  },
  {
    label: 'Second tab',
    initialRoute: routes.SECOND_TAB_INITIAL_ROUTE()
  },
  {
    label: 'Another tab',
    initialRoute: routes.ANOTHER_TAB_INITIAL_ROUTE()
  }
];
```
Then, use them as prop of the root component. This time, we will use `TabsContainer`:

```js
import { TabsContainer } from 'react-native-renavigate';

import store from './store';
import routes from './routes';
import tabs from './tabs';

export default function index() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <TabsContainer
        tabs={tabs}
        routes={routes}
      />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

renavigate uses [react-native-scrollable-tab-view](https://github.com/skv-headless/react-native-scrollable-tab-view) out of the box to implement tabs, however this component can be easily replaced.

#### 3- Give the navigation reducer to redux
Our root components will listen to store changes to trigger transitions, but first we need to add the renavigate reducer to the store.

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { reducer as renavigateReducer } from 'react-native-renavigate';

const reducers = {
  // ... your other reducers here ...
  renavigate: renavigateReducer     // <---- Mounted at 'renavigate'
}
const reducer = combineReducers(reducers)
const store = createStore(reducer)
```

#### 4- Navigate!
As mentioned before, `renavigate` transforms the Navigator API to redux actions so you can dispatch the following actions to trigger transitions.

```js
import { actionCreators } from 'react-native-renavigate';

class MyComponent extends Component {

  handleTransition = (post) => {
    // Navigate forward to a new scene, squashing any scenes that you could jump forward to.
    this.props.dispatch(actionCreators.push.ROUTE_NAME());

    // Navigate to a new scene and reset route stack.
    // this.props.dispatch(actionCreators.resetTo.ROUTE_NAME());

    // Transition back and unmount the current scene.
    // this.props.dispatch(actionCreators.pop());

    // Pop to the first scene in the stack, unmounting every other scene.
    // this.props.dispatch(actionCreators.popToTop());
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={this.handleTransition}>
        <Text>Transition!</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
  }
}
```

## TODO List
- Tests
- Test time travel debugging
- Add more examples
- Handle android back button
- Improve docs about styling and customizing navbar and tabbar
- Docs about customizing or replacing scrollable-tab-view
- Refactor readme: Include Docs & Help section with examples and API doc.
- Support all navigation methods
- Hiding tabbar
- Refactor actionsCreators import to just actions. use bindActionCreators from redux.
